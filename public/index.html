            <p>
              Think of the block chain as a distributed database where each database has a copy of every transaction. This means that the data is always correct as you have many more copies to verify against.

            <h2>What is the purpose of cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>
               The original intention behind Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was to create an electronic cash system people could use in daily transactions. You technically can buy and sell things with it, but Bitcoinâ€™s price fluctuates quickly, which makes it a poor fit for spending instead of cash. You could spend $50 worth of Bitcoin on something today that ends up being worth $20 tomorrow.
